**Openstack Component Testing Ansible Roles**

Octario is a collection of Ansible roles and playbooks for testing Openstack Components on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora.

The plan is to support the following testers:

* PEP8
* Unittest
* Functional
* API
* Scenario

**This is not related to Tempest in any way and will only run tests that are in component directory**
